# Keep meta files for the dlls, only they matter.
# All meta files get deleted on the first load, which is why we need not to ignore the dll.
# The dll's meta file contains additional configuration, and we don't want it to get deleted.
# I'm going to keep all contents of the package besides the nupkg and the signature.
